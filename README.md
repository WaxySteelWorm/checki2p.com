# CheckI2P.com

Welcome to the GitHub repository for [CheckI2P.com](https://checki2p.com), a simple yet powerful tool designed to enhance the security and privacy of I2P network users. Our mission is to provide a quick and reliable way for users to verify their connection to an I2P Outproxy, ensuring their online activities are private and secure.

## About

The Invisible Internet Project (I2P) is a network layer that allows for secure and anonymous communication over the internet. A critical component of using I2P effectively is ensuring that your traffic is routed through an I2P Outproxy when accessing websites outside the I2P network. CheckI2P.com is developed to provide you with a quick sanity check for this purpose.

### How It Works

When you visit CheckI2P.com, the site checks your current internet routing and displays one of two messages:

- "You are NOT using a known outproxy" if your connection is not routed through an I2P Outproxy.
- "You are connected to [insert outproxy name]" if you are successfully connected through a recognized I2P Outproxy.

## Contributing

We believe in the power of community-driven development and encourage contributions to this project. There are several ways you can contribute:

3. **Feedback and Suggestions**: Have ideas on how we can improve CheckI2P.com? Open an issue and share your thoughts. We're particularly interested in additional functionalities that could be useful for I2P users.

## Future Plans

We aim to expand CheckI2P.com to include more comprehensive tools for testing various I2P functions. Your feedback and suggestions play a vital role in shaping the future of this project.
